1. Finish Core AI Programming Loop
 1.1 Create list of commands to win 100% against built in sc2 easy AI (90% -- will defeat easy AI, but improvements need to be made)
   a. Buffer Asyc issues (Bot is stuttering with commands) (100%)
   b. Figure out optimal rax amount (50% -- Algo. is sloppy.)
   c. Finish Wall In section
 1.2 Code several alterative 'build-orders' 
 1.3 Examine best performing ones
 1.4 Write Code for AI to randomly select a build-order and track preformance at higher base AI
 1.5 Standarize Results for ML
